Marchtool is a simple tool to get started with/rapidly prototype 3D ray marching. This program is more of a toy than an actual tool at this stage, but who knows what'll happen to it.

When starting the program for the first time, a shader.fs file will be generated containing some sample code. The function "SceneSDF" must remain for the program to function. The shader and opengl profile is 3.3 core.
